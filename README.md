DLblitz aims to be a download management system that allows a user to quickly request files using a variety of protocols, and using a variety of privacy-enhancing proxies, anonymous overlays, and encryption methods. 

It is still in an early phase of development. As such, you should not use it if you have a need for strong anonymity and privacy.
